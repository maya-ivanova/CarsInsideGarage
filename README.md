## 📖 About the Project

Write 2–4 sentences describing what the application does, what problem it solves, and for whom it was built.

**Example:**  
This is a simple task management web application built as part of the *ASP.NET Fundamentals* course. It demonstrates core concepts like MVC architecture, Entity Framework Core, and RESTful API design.

The application helps drivers find parking with ease while giving property owners an easy way to earn extra cash. It matches a driver’s location or destination with nearby available parking spots and handles everything from fee management to automated billing, providing a one-click revenue report to owners. It’s designed to also be suitable to private driveway owners giving them the chance to rent out their space 24/7, whether they’re at work, traveling, or just out shopping.

## 🗄️ Database Setup

The project uses **Entity Framework Core** with a Code-First approach.

Connection string is configured in `appsettings.json`:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=YourDbName;Trusted_Connection=True;"
}
```

To create and seed the database:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Key settings in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "your-connection-string-here"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit sensitive data** (passwords, API keys) to source control. Use `appsettings.Development.json` or environment variables for local secrets.
